### ascii
Turn an image-file into ascii. Scales image down and maps each pixel to an
ascii character by brightness.

### lerp 
"Linear interpolation" between same-sized images. Produces a third new image
that is faded _halfway_ between two consecutive images. (Originally this
started out as an automation tool for making fades between animation frames,
but could now be better suited for low-to-no-control superimposement of images
":D")

### cursed
Does some shifty stuff with an images pixels; throwaway.

### raycast
Makes an image that contains a sphere. Sphere made with code translated from
an old university course assignment.
